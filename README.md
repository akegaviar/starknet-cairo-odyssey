# Starket and Cairo Odyssey

This repo contains first steps, tips and learnings to use StarkNet and create smart contracts using Cairo.

The two articles have been published in the [Chainstack blog](https://chainstack.com/)

## Cairo code samples

You can find differe contracts with examples in the `code-app` folder. Make sure to follow instructions to setup your development environment, explained in the first article.

The `code-app` is a Nile project so it's recommended to install it as well.

### Run tests

The test files in the `caido-app/tests/` folder can be run using `pytest`.
